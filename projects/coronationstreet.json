Difficult, gruff and rude, his first business with the firm didn't go well when Peter Barlow was late, meeting Tina McIntyre and trying to get her not to leave Weatherfield for a new life in London. Carla Barlow rang Peter and asked where he was and he span a lie that he was stuck in traffic and Hanlon had cancelled - even though he was sat in front of her at the time. Peter was surprised, to say the least, to see the man sat in the factory office when he finally turned up. Carla saved the deal and Peter managed to convince her that he had gone to an impromptu AA meeting when the desire for a drink started to overwhelm him.",

It wasn't until nearly fifty years later in 2010 that the letter was discovered by newsagent Norris Cole. Ken was given the letter, and he discovered that Susan had died some years earlier, but had a son Lawrence.
